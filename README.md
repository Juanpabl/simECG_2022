# simECG_2022

This is the MATLAB code repository for the ECG simulator described in L. Bachi, H. Halvaei, C. Pérez, A. Martín-Yebra, A. Petrėnas, A. Sološenko, L. Johnson, V. Marozas, J. P. Martínez, E. Pueyo, M. Stridh, P. Laguna, and L. Sörnmo, ECG Modeling for Simulation of Arrhythmias in Time-Varying Conditions, IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 2023, [https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2023.3288701](doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2023.3288701).

Additional documentation in the form of a user guide will be included here shortly.

The simulator is best used by setting the simulation parameters in the "simECG_main.m" script, and running the script. In order to run, the simulator requires data files which can be downloaded at [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1c2Wb5pHfL21iL0CsnQIi7HsPUDi3AFBz?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1c2Wb5pHfL21iL0CsnQIi7HsPUDi3AFBz?usp=sharing).

The authors have no intention of adding additional functionalities to the simulator. However, reporting of bugs or unintended behaviors of the code is very appreciated. If you wish to report a bug or an unintened behavior of the ECG simulator, please email l.bachi@santannapisa.it, possibly by documenting the issue with screenshots.

This ECG simulator is built on the simulator described in A. Petrėnas, V. Marozas, A. Sološenko, R. Kubilius, J. Skibarkienė, J. Oster and L. Sörnmo, "Electrocardiogram modeling duringparoxysmal atrial fibrillation: application to the detection of brief episodes", Physiological Measurement, 2017, [https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6579/aa9153](doi.org/10.1088/1361-6579/aa9153).
